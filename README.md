# todoPad
## Overview
### In One Sentence
todoPad is a simple text editor with syntax highlighting for [todo.txt](http://www.todotxt.com/) files.

### In More Words
Think Notepad with some colours/bold font, and you're there. 

todoPad highlights task priority, creation date, and any projects or contexts you have. Completed tasks are shaded gray and italicized.

todoPad is written in C#, and targets .NET 4.5 (though it might work on earlier versions of the framework.)

## Rationale
The [todo.txt format](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format) is beautifully simple, easy to use, and effective. Unfortunately, most todo.txt clients tend to mimic more traditional task management apps; there's a set process to add or edit tasks, with dialogs and items to click.

That makes sense on a mobile device, but on the desktop it doesn't really work too well: why bother, when all you really need is just the raw text? Notepad fit this bill very well.

But everything looked a little plain. And so here we are.
